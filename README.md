Project expectations:

This will be my first project from The Odin Project and I feel confident 
that it will help me get acquianted further with how to create a simple
webpage. It is also an opportunity for me to use the HTML and CSS 
skills that I have learned so far through TOP and FCC.

Project reflection:

It was easier than I thought because google's homepage is as clean and simple 
as it goes. I did most work without having to look up codes, and I'm feeling 
more and more confident with my web development skills. For my first project,
I'm going to say that it went well.
